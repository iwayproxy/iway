// DNS cache removed. Previously implemented with `moka` but the feature
// was deleted to reduce complexity. This file intentionally left minimal
// to avoid build issues if referenced accidentally.

// If you want to fully remove this file, delete it and remove any
// remaining references. Currently the module declaration in
// `src/protocol/tuic/mod.rs` has been removed.
